title:
Circumference of a Triangle



description:
Given a list of triangles in the 2d plane 
Return the size of the largest triangle circumference,
round to nearest integer

The list of triangles is given in the following format
t1v1x,t1v1y,t1v2x,t1v2y,t1v3x,t1v3y
t2v1x,t2v1y,t2v2x,t2v2y,t2v3x,t2v3y
t3v1x,t3v1y,t3v2x,t3v2y,t3v3x,t3v3y
...

where t1v1x = x-coordinate of vertex 1 of triangle 1
	  t1v1y = y-coordinate of vertex 1 of triangle 1
where t1v2x = x-coordinate of vertex 2 of triangle 1
	  t1v2y = y-coordinate of vertex 2 of triangle 1

and t2v1x = x-coordinate of vertex 1 of triangle 2
	t2v1y = y-coordinate of vertex 1 of triangle 2

etc.
